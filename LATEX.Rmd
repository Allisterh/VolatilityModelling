## Models

This analysis considers ...

**GARCH(p,q) of Bollerslev (1986)**

$$r_t = \mu + \epsilon_t ,\ \ \epsilon_t = \sigma_tz_t$$
$$\sigma^2_t = \omega + \sum_{i=1}^{q} \alpha_i \epsilon^2_{t-i} + \sum^p_{j=1} \beta_j \sigma^2_{t-j}$$
where $r_t$ is the log-return, $\sigma^2_t$ is the conditional variance, $\omega$ a constant term, and $\epsilon^2_t$ are residuals obtained from the mean filtering process. The ARCH and GARCH orders are determined by $q$ and $p$ respectively. $p = 0$ gives the ARCH(q) model as specified by Engle(1982), while $q > 0$ leads the more general GARCH(p,q) specified by Bollerslev (1986). The analysis here considers only the GARCH(1,1). 

$$z_t \sim iid \ N(0,1)$$

**Threshold GARCH (TGARCH) of Zakoian (1994)**

$$r_t = \mu + \epsilon_t ,\ \ \epsilon_t = \sigma_tz_t$$
$$\sigma_t=\omega + \sum^q_{i=1}\alpha_i(\lvert\epsilon_{t-i}\rvert-\gamma_i\epsilon_{t-i}) + \sum^p_{j=1}\beta_j\sigma_{t-j}  $$
with $\sigma_t$ denoting the conditional standard deviaion. $\omega$ represents a constant term and $\epsilon_t$ are residuals obtained from the mean model. $q$ and $p$ give the ARCH and GARCH orders respectively. 

$$z_t \sim iid \ N(0,1)$$

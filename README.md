Volatility permeates the economy. It influences the pricing of assets, options and derivatives as well as portfolio formation. Volatility forecasting, therefore, plays a prominent role in financial decision-making. While it has been shown that one-day ahead volatility forecasts are surprisingly accurate, longer horizon forecasts are more relevant for institutions trading illiquid assets. Generally, models estimated during normal times perform poorly during sudden volatility shocks. In many cases, positions can take days if not weeks to unwind, necessitating quality longer-term volatility forecasts.
